@* lifecycle methods will be called inside both the parent and child components *@

@* when the lifecycle gets triggered, i want to display which lifecycle was called in which order *@

@* in order to do that, call a list of string and and log in it everytime a lifecycle is called *@

@* the first lifecycles to work on are OnInitialized and OnInitializedAsync: it is executed when the component is completely loaded *@

@* the next lifecycles to work on are OnParametersSet and OnParametersSetAsync: these are called each time a new or updated parameter is received from parent in the rendered tree *@
